# Econometrics-with-Machine-Learning
This is the place where the example files of the book I wrote, "Economics with Machine Learning(Korean, 머신러닝의 계량경제학), are stored. These files are written in the Jupiter notebook code and will be available for practice directly on Google Colab through the link to the e-book.
