# Econometrics-with-Machine-Learning
This is the repository where the example files of the book I wrote, "Economics with Machine Learning(in Korean, 머신러닝의 계량경제학), are stored. These files are composed with Jupyter notebook code and will be available for practice directly on Google Colab through the link to the e-book.
